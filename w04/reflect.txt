1. Parallel arrays provide us the ability to group related data. Using what you coded in this 
workshop, briefly explain how you linked related data for any given item in the dataset? What 
was the ‘key’ used to accomplish this?

- I have used arrays to store values of same data type in this workshop. To get the expected values i iterate the arrays.
  after iteration i scored values using "scanf" and using "printf" i displayed all the collected values of arreys.


2. Why do you think it is common practice to iterate arrays initializing the iterator variable to zero 
and not to a value of one? Justify your answer using an example from this workshop.

- It is good practice to iterate arrays initializing the iterator variable to zero rather than one because
 first element of array can be declared only with value of array[i=0].
 for example , array[3]={a,b,c,d}     (using i=0, we will receive a b c d) 
               for (i=0;i<3;i++){
			   printf("%c",i)};
 if we use i=1
             array[3]={a,b,c,d}   ( using i=1 , we will receive b c d) 
	         for (i=1;i<3;i++){     (we will not recceive value of element 1)
              printf("%c",i)};

3. How would you describe conceptually what an array is to a child (5-8-year-old)? How would you 
describe accessing an element in the array? Warning: keep your explanation simple or the child 
will not understand.

- i would describe array is useful to store multiple values at the sametime. elements in array starts with 
  0, hence we can access element 1 using array 0, we can access element 2 using array 1 and so on.
  for example array[0]=element 1
              array[1]=element 2
