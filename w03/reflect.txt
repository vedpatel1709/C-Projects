1. Mapping the month integer value to the first three characters of the month name could have 
been accomplished using one of two possible selection constructs. What are they, and provide 
a short example of how each would be written in C to display the first two months? 

- There are two possible selection constructs which we can use to display first three characters
   of month name from month integer value.
   int month;
  1st is If-else :
   if (month = 1)
   {
   printf("JAN");
   } 

   else if (month = 2)
   {
   printf("FAB");
   }

 2nd is switch-case statement:
  switch(month){
  case 1: printf("JAN");
  break;
  case 2: printf("FAB");
  break;
  }

2. The logic applied to validate the values entered by the user required iteration. What are the 3 
types of iteration constructs? What one did you use for the validation routines, and briefly 
explain why?

- There are 3 types of iteration constructs . First is for loop , second is do-while loop ,and third is while loop.
  i used do-while loop because we need to exacute "printf and scanf" atleast one time ,but for loop and while loop 
  will varify condition first after varifing it will exacute statement . And this is why do-while loop works better
  there and i used it do-while loop.

3. Describe what you did to test and debug your program. How did you go about finding where 
the problems were located?

-I used debugger to find my error . while coding i wrote printf and scanf function to get value from user but when i 
run the program compiler was just printing a statement instead of asking me value , then i used debuging processing and 
that showed my error was in scanf line . i mistakely wrote %.2lf insted of %lf in scanf . that is how debug program help me 
to correct my mistake.
