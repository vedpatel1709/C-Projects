   This assignment was really confusing to me. 
But using weekly reading and re-watching lectures really helped me. 
While doing first two milestone I learned how to use .h and .c file. 
Using this we can divide our work into small parts.
 
 
   To work more efficiently I learned functions. Functions are really helpful.
 Functions can save our time because we do not need to define a new function every time.
 For example, in this assignment I had declared “findContactIndex” and “getTenDigitPhone” in the beginning.
 Whenever I need to get number from user, I simply call “getTenDigitPhone”. 
 And whenever I want to find contact index, I simply call “findContactIndex”. 
 This two functions saved my time and efforts. 


  Yes, I would like to add a functionality to load/save the contact information from/to text file.
This functionality will improve the efficiently of this code. After adding this function, 
we do not need to save contacts one by one. That will save user’s time.


  Overall, this assignment improved my learning because I corrected almost 200 errors in this assignment.
