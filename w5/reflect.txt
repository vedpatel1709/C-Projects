1. Describe the benefits and advantages of using user - defined types(structures) in this workshop.
You must explain your answer using an example from this workshop.

- Main benefits of using structures in this workshop is that structures can hold multiple data-types. We do not need to redefine data types.
  For example, i have used two structs to store the information of player and information of game.
  In both structs i have defined multiple data types of integers and characters. 


2. If we enhanced this workshop to keep a history of games played including the endgame results,
briefly describe what two major logical changes you would have to make to your program to make
this possible ?

- I will create one more struct that will store the values of results .
 To store the values in struct i will create arrays in it.
 and i will place that arrays at the end of the loop that will store result of everygame.  


3. What part of this workshop did you spend the most time working on ? What did you do to
overcome your difficulties ?

- I have spent around 5 to 6 hours to complete this workshop. Among them i have spent my most of the time in arrays.
  Because of i have created morethan 20 loops i get confuced everytime while placing arrays to store and print values.
  To overcome this problem i used 'comment' technique . Using comment I wrote details of loop at the end of the loop.
  That helped me a lot.
